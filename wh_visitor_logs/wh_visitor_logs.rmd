#Question 1: Who visits the most? 
Answer: For visitors that recorded their full names Michael N Herzog had visited the white house the most with 108 visits. After doing research I found that he's Israel's Ambassador to the U.S.

#Question 2: Who gets the most visitors? 

Answer: When you take away staff that would generally deal with the public the top five White House officials in order of number of visits received are: VPOTUS(4306 visits)  this is Kamala Harris 
FLOTUS (1905 visits) this is First Lady, Jill Biden 

Tarun Chhabra (1853 visits) Tarun served on the White House National Security Council staff as Director for Strategic Planning and Director for Human Rights and National Security Issues, according to his bio at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology. 

Claudia Marconi (1657 visit) Claudia Marconi is White House Senior Advisor for Congressional Engagement. She  in charge of all the logistical details of Members of Congress’ engagement for events and meetings at the White House, and travel with the President and First Lady.

John Finer (1432  visits) – Finer is the Principal Deputy National Security Advisor at the White House. He previously served as Chief of Staff and Director of Policy Planning at the U.S. Department of State, according to his bio on

#Question #3 How frequently does the president get visitors? Robert, which % of all visits are the POTUS. 
Answer: Roughly 8.9% of visitors to the white house log that they are visiting just the POTUS.

```
#Question# 4 What time of the day is the busiest for visitors? Which day of the week? Which week of the year?
Answer: The hour that receives the greatest number of visits is 10 a.m. July was the month with the most number of visits. Week 24 in mid June was the week with the greatest amounts of visits, and Saturday was the day of the week with the most number of visits.

***Final Milestone Discussion ***




***Milestone 3 Discussion***

For me personally, the most interesting story that I can derive from the data is most frequent person visited.  I don’t think it will make a hard news story, but it could be a feature about a behind-the-scenes but important member of the White House staff. Many of the visitors going to the White House do not specify whom they are visiting. A majority of the visitors (%56) specify that they are visiting the visitor’s office. The top person visited there is the President of the United States (POTUS). But outside of POTUS, the most visited person, according to White House record logs, is not a top political advisor, but a drum major and the Director of Ceremonies at the White House. Ed Telkey is more visited that FLOTUS and more visited than the vice president. %2.1 of guests to the White House who specify the person they are visiting are visiting Telkey. What is his job and why do so many people want to see him? 


***Milestone 2 Discussion*** 
Flaws and limitations hindering us answering our questions: after cleaning up the data, we believe we will be able to answer question 1 regarding who visited the white house most in 2022 and 2023. 

We also believe we will be able to answer question 2 - who is visited most often - by looking at the most frequently listed visitees. 

We can also look at what percentage of the visits are to the POTUS (president) or even to the FLOTUS (first lady)

For which time of day, day of the week, etc. is busiest, we could toa data, however there are several NAs in that column. So any findings we make will have to be caveated by that. Also, the date and time are combined in one column, we may need to look into how we can split those. 

Question 5 - the average length of appointment is UNATAINABLE. While time of arrival (toa) is recorded, time of departure (tod) is not. Appointment end date is always 11:59 the day of the appointment. The data will not allow us to determine length of appointments. 

Question 6 - how frequently does house or senate leadership visit the WH? A better question is what percentage of the logged visits are from leaders of the house or senate. We haven't thoroughly investigated this question yet, but we believe that we could create a list of names of high-ranking leadership: speaker of the house, minority whip, etc., and write a code using string detect and mutate to create a column that will be marked as yes if the entry is from a member of the house/senate leadership, and no if it is not. 

Additional note: cleaning up the dates, particularly in the appointment_start_date column. We believe this is because the dates are characters and some are written with the hour and minute format and others are not. Not sure if this is something that can be resolved by using open refine?
